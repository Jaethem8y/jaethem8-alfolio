Hey there 👋🏼 I'm Jae and I am glad to see you here. I am a graduate student pursuing phd in Computer Science.

Before starting graduate school at Iowa State, I got my BS in Computer Science and minor in Math from Drake University.

I am currently interested in Formal Methods, specifically model checking and theorem proving. For me it's crazy how one can give **assurance** of system behavior.

Computer Science education also holds a special place in my heart. I have met great mentors throughout my higher education, and I hope to play the same role for the students in my community.

Outside of Computer World, I enjoy lifting and training judo.

Following is the primary record that this webpage will have:

---

1. Progress in school/research 🤔
2. Progress in my hobbies 🤼
3. Random rants 🗣️
